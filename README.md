# Jetpack-Paging3
Jetpack Paging3 Sample

This is a basic sample I tried to understand the Jetpack paging3 library.
It contains a listing via network using Paging3. Checkout to understand the ease of adding footers with retry and list item seperators.
Also helps to get understanding of other Jetpack components like navigation, data-binding, viewmodel and livedata.
