# Jetpack-Paging3
Jetpack Paging3 Sample

This is a basic sample I tried to understand the Jetpack paging3 library.
It contains a listing via network using Paging3. Checkout to understand the ease of adding footers with retry and list item seperators.
Also helps to get understanding of other Jetpack components like navigation, data-binding, viewmodel and livedata.

Paging 3 is the rewrite of the paging library using Kotlin coroutines,  that helps you load and display pages of data incrementally from local storage or over network, allowing apps to use network bandwidth and system resources more efficiently. This new release adds highly requested features like separators, headers, footers and list transformations and APIs for observing list loading state and methods for retry and refresh.
